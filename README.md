## Description

This Streamlit web app utilizes a custom-built convolutional neural network (CNN) that we developed and trained specifically for 10 distinct categories. The model analyzes image arrays to detect AI-generated content, providing detailed scores for each image.

## Groups

1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

## Features

- Detects AI-generated content in images
- Generate AI-images based on user prompt to test app
